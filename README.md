# Text Completing Editor
Effortlessly customize your text with this tool! Instantly adjust. Say goodbye to manual edits!
## Usage
- Paste your content and enclose parameters in brackets.
  e.g:
  
  ```
  Hey, I'm [name]. I'm trying this awesome tool.
  ```
-  Then a `name` parameter input will be created, where you can modify it, changing it on every part of the text where that parameter is used.
-  This is highly recommended for long text templates for emails, or messages. Where you need to use the same text structure, changing some parts of it.
